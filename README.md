<h2>About Me</h2>

I've been involved in web development for approximately 8 months, and during this time, I've learned the following technologies: Python + Django, HTML-CSS. Additionally, I'm working on WordPress development. My main focus is creating functional and aesthetically pleasing websites. I'm currently continuing my education and growth in this field. From time to time, I'll be sharing some of my interesting projects here.
